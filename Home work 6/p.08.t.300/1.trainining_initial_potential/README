Input:
- the initial configuration for the potential initialization in `MLIP` internal format (train_init.cfg)
- the script allows calculating minimal distance between atoms in initial configuration (calc_mindist.sh)
- the script for the initial potential fitting (train_initial_potential.sh)

The file 08.mtp should be copied from the folder `untrained_mtps/` containing in the `MLIP-2` repository `https://gitlab.com/ashapeev/mlip-2` to this folder. The appropriate minimal distance should be specified in this file
